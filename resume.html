              I initiated the development of a web application using Spring Boot to help gardeners input their garden yields 
              and calculate yearly nutritional values. The tech stack includes MongoDB for the backend and HTML, CSS, and 
              Vanilla JS for the frontend. I've also created a RESTful API to connect these components. It's still a work in 
              progress and as of right now I am implementing the table that shows the summed nutritional values.

              private, and connecting students with their proper means of help.

              Four other students and I were challenged to solve a transportation conflict in San Luis Obispo. We created a wire framed
              app that incentivized riding the bus for students by gamifying the process. After creating the prototype we were given the 
              task of creating a pitch trying to sell our idea to a panel of judges.
